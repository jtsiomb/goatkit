GoatKit - a widget toolkit for games
------------------------------------

1. Overview

GoatKit is a widget toolkit library designed for creating user interface screens
in OpenGL games.

It's simple in the sense that it doesn't provide complex GUI hierarchies.
Instead of windows, it's based on non-overlapping screens with widgets on them.
However it's fully animatable, and themable, which are extremely important for
making flashy UIs for the various game menu and options screens.

Themable: the library itself doesn't do any drawing at all. Widget drawing is
instead left to plugin themes (which are simple shared libraries/dlls), which
can completely define the visuals and animations of any kind of widget. The
intention is to have a different theme made for each game, that fits the game's
particular visual style.

Animatable: all typically boolean properties in regular toolkits, such as
being visible, active, or hovered, are floating point values in the [0, 1]
interval instead of being of type bool. This allows the theme to vary the visual
properties such as blending, position, scale or whatever else based on these
values. So widgets can expand into visibility, slowly glow while being hovered
over, or whatever else the particular theme needs.
